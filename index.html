        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The Saline Machine, developed in 2023 under the guidance of Mr. Frederick, 
            a lecturer at Temasek Polytechnic's Advanced Manufacturing Centre, is a remarkable achievement. 
            This project successfully replicates an industrial saline production system with precision. 
            Equipped with advanced data analysis tools, it enables continuous performance monitoring and environmental impact assessment,
            ensuring maximum operational efficiency.

            <h2>Purpose of this Project</h2>
            <p>The saline production machine is a multi-disciplinary project that integrates electronics, mechatronics, 
                computer engineering, and biomedical engineering. Its purpose is to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of how a 
                manufacturing system operates on a production line. The system is designed to allow roles such as operations managers and sustainability officers 
                to track key performance indicators, including Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) and sustainability metrics. 
                While the machine closely replicates a real-world production system, further improvements are necessary to fully align it with industrial standards
                and ensure it functions as an actual industry-grade system.

        <h3>Shift Instructions for Standardization:</h3>

        <h4>For Maintenance Check:</h4>
        <ol ol>
            <li>On the machine via the power supply. Note that the OEE “Stop Duration” will start running. The machine automatically goes to “Stop” mode.</li>
            <li>Go to “Manual” mode. Empty all the water in the pipes by opening all the valves and using air pressure. Note that “Manual Duration” will start running.</li>
            <li>Empty all the water in the mixing bin, stock bin, and diluent bin by opening all the relevant valves. Remember to turn off the valves when emptied.</li>
            <li>Put the machine on “Stop” mode. Empty the waste bin by pumping out the water and fill the water supply tank with clean water.</li>
            <li>Go to “Manual” mode and check that all the valves and mixer are working properly by turning them off and on.</li>
            <li>Go back to “Main Page”, click on “Ideal Page” then key in the relevant values.</li>
        </ol ol>

        <h4>For Stock Solution Testing:</h4>
        <ol ol>
            <li>Return to “Main Page”, click on “Stock Tank”.</li>
            <li>In the “Quality Check (Stock Tank)” page, at “Step 1”, click on “Testing”.</li>
            <li>Then in “Step 2”, click on “Auto”. Both the diluent and stock tank will be filled.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, in “Step 3”, the “Ready for Concentrate” light will light up. Add in the concentrate.</li>
            <li>Click the button below “Concentrate Successfully Added”. A bit of the stock solution will flow to the waste bin where the conductivity sensor will detect the solution’s conductivity (+ concentration).</li>
            <li>In the “Quality Check (Stock Tank)” page, an indication will pop up displaying whether the stock solution concentration is high, low, or satisfactory. Fix the concentration accordingly if needed.</li>
            <li>After testing, in the “Quality Check (Stock Tank)” page, click on “Not Testing” at “Step 1”. The light indicator for “Not Testing” should be on all the time except when the stock solution is being tested.</li>
        </ol ol>

        <h4>For Normal Production:</h4>
        <ol ol>
            <li>From the “Main Page”, click on “Settings”.</li>
            <li>When redirected to the “Settings” page, press on the “AUTO” button. Both the diluent and stock tank will be filled. <strong>(MUST RELOOK)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> Stock and Diluent tank should not be filled as they were already filled when the stock solution was being tested.</li>
            <li>Return to the “Main Page”, click on “Concentration”. In the “Concentration” page, click the button below “Concentrate Successfully Added” and select the preferred concentration. The saline will then be produced accordingly.</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> There should be no need to indicate that “Concentrate Successfully Added”.</li>
            <li>After the saline bottles are produced, from the “Main Page”, click on “OEE” to be redirected to the “OEE Page” then key in the number of bad bottles (Number of good bottles will automatically update after the number of bad bottles are keyed in).</li>
            <li>Click on the “Rejection Reasons” button to key in the number of bad bottles rejected to the specific category.</li>
